# Map logical motor names to MotorKit stepper channels (1â€“4)
motors:
  x_left:   1
  x_right:  2
  z_axis:   3

# How many microsteps equals 1 mm of travel on each axis
calibration:
  steps_per_mm_x: 80    # e.g. 80 microsteps per mm on the X rails
  steps_per_mm_z: 100   # e.g. 100 microsteps per mm on the Z lead screw

# Stepping style and pause between each microstep
step_style: "MICROSTEP"  # or "DOUBLE", "SINGLE", etc., per adafruit_motor.stepper
step_delay: 0.01         # seconds to wait between microsteps
